        ## Using ZenHub

        ## What is ZenHub?

        ZenHub is a project management and collaboration solution built for agile development teams. It is a lightweight browser extension (compatible with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox)  that injects several features directly to GitHub’s user interface – adding a “strategic layer” that sits on top of GitHub.

        By centralizing your team’s workflows in a single tool,  you can avoid time spent “context switching” from tool to tool – writing tickets, finding files, or updating queues.
        What you’ll learn
        In this course, you’ll learn how to use ZenHub to manage GitHub projects
        How to visualize your workflow with ZenHub Boards
        How to estimate complexity and track project velocity with Burndown Charts
        How to create your own personal task management flow

         You’ll also be familiarized with best practices for kanban, scrum, and agile workflows.

        Downloading ZenHub
        To download ZenHub, visit ZenHub.io, then click “Add ZenHub to GitHub”.
        In the permissions modal, click “Add” to enable ZenHub features to run natively  in your GitHub interface.

        You’ll be redirected to GitHub.com, where you’ll see several new features added to the GitHub user interface. Everything you do in ZenHub (aside from payments or license management, which are done through the ZenHub Dashboard) is done from GitHub.com.

        Notice the new “Z” button in your browser – this is the ZenHub Notification Center.


        You can click the Notification Center to see your team’s recent activity, seek help, or navigate to your ZenHub Dashboard.
